# TasmotaInvita
For ESP8266
Automatically invites your newly flashed Tasmota devices into your WiFi network, by scanning for TASMOTA AP-mode devices and providing them with your SSID and Password.
Saves you a couple of minutes per device, no need to use your phone, and no more typos, all for the price of a NodeMCU.

An LED very gently breathes in the background without annoying your peripheral vision, but lights up brightly when a new device is found and invited.
If you keep a serial console open, you even get a list of the MAC addresses. Your DHCP server (router) will tell you the IP address of each new device.
